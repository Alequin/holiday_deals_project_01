## My Project ##

Holiday Deals Tracker

MVP:

- Add a Travel agent
- Add holidays available at a travel agent and view them as a list
- Add a list of deals for a travel agent where a deal has Label string e.g. "10% off"
- A list of holidays that deal applies to
- The time period that the deal is available for e.g. "01/01/2017 - 01/05/2017"

Possible Extensions:

- Show the deals available and what point in the year they are available at
- Add a price to a holiday and add a savings amount/percentage to a deal so it's
  clear how much Jarrod is saving Any other ideas you might come up with
