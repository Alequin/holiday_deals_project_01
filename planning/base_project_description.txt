## Base Project ##

Burger Tracker

MVP:

Add a burger eatery
Add burgers available at an eatery and view them as a list
Add a list of deals for an eatery where a deal has
Label string e.g. "Two For One Tuesdays"
A list of burgers that deal applies to
The day that the deal is available on e.g. "Wednesday"
Possible Extensions:

Show the deals available by day of the week Mon - Sun
Add a price to a burger and add a savings amount/percentage to a deal so it's
clear how much Jarrod is saving Any other ideas you might come up with
